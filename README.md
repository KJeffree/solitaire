This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I found a [card api](https://deckofcardsapi.com) and decided that I wanted to try and create a game using it. I love to play Solitaire, so I chose to replicate it using React.

To run the game, clone this repo, run `npm i` and then `npm start`. Go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the app.
